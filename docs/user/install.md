# Install RUNE

RUNE is a web and desktop GUI for running coding agents on your machine.

## Requirements

Node.js `^22.16 || ^23.11 || >=24.10` on the machine that runs the RUNE server.

At least one provider CLI, installed and authenticated. See [Providers](#providers) below.

## Run Without Installing

```bash
npx rune@latest
```

This starts the RUNE server on your machine and opens the local web app. Use
`npx rune@latest --help` for the full CLI reference.

## Desktop App

Download the latest release from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pingdotgg/rune/releases), or install from a package
registry.

Windows:

```bash
winget install RUNETools.Rune
```

macOS:

```bash
brew install --cask rune
```

Arch Linux:

Stable:

```bash
yay -S rune-bin
```

Nightly:

```bash
yay -S rune-nightly-bin
```

## Providers

RUNE drives provider CLIs; it does not ship them. Install the CLI for each provider you want
to use, then authenticate it.

| Provider    | CLI                                                             | Default binary | Log in with                |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| Codex       | [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli)            | `codex`        | `codex login`              |
| Claude      | [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)           | `claude`       | `claude auth login`        |
| Antigravity | [Antigravity CLI](https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/install/) | `agy`          | run `agy` once and sign in |
| Cursor      | [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli)                            | `cursor-agent` | `agent login`              |
| Grok Build  | [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli)                              | `grok`         | `grok login`               |
| OpenCode    | [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai)                                 | `opencode`     | `opencode auth login`      |

Codex, Claude, and Antigravity are on by default. Cursor, Grok Build, and OpenCode are off by
default; turn them on in **Settings** → the provider's card when you want to use them.

Cursor is the one to watch: install Cursor CLI, which provides the `cursor-agent` binary that
RUNE looks for, but authenticate with `agent login`, not `cursor-agent login`.

Run the login command on the machine running the RUNE server, not on the device you browse
from.

### Binary Discovery

Each provider CLI must be on the server's `PATH`, or have an explicit binary path set in
**Settings** → the provider instance → **Binary path**. Use the explicit path when a version
manager or a non-standard install location keeps the CLI off the `PATH` of the shell that
started RUNE.

### When Auth Is Needed

Provider auth is required before you start a session with that provider, not before you start
RUNE. You can install RUNE, open it, and add providers afterwards. A provider that is not
authenticated shows its status in **Settings** and fails at session start with the login command
to run.

For provider-specific setup, see [Codex](./providers-codex.md), [Claude](./providers-claude.md),
and [Antigravity](./providers-antigravity.md). If you use OpenRouter or another Claude-compatible
gateway, configure it in **Settings** → the Claude provider card → **Claude Code service**; that
setup does not require running `/login` for the gateway.

## Next Steps

- [Permission modes](./permission-modes.md): how much RUNE asks before acting
- [Remote access](./remote-access.md): connect from a phone, tablet, or another desktop
- [Keeping RUNE in sync](./updating.md): client and server version skew
- [Running in the background](./background-service.md): Linux background service
